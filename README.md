## Filters
The `Filters.py` file contains the implementation of various filters provided in **BrushMagic**. Here's a brief overview of each filter:

- **Classic Monochrome** : This filter converts the image to grayscale and allows you to adjust the degree of intensity.
- **Rainbow Radiance Filter** : Rainbow Radiance Filter intensifies colors in the image by applying a power factor to each color channel.
- **Pencil Sketch** : Create artistic pencil sketch effects by inverting the grayscale image and blending it with a blurred version.
- **Vintage Filter** : The Vintage Filter adds vintage colors and noise to the images, giving them a retro look based on predefined color levels.
- **Light Leak Effect** :Add a dramatic touch to the images with the Light Leak Effect, blending the original image with a light leak overlay.
- **Vignette Filter** :The Vignette Filter darkens the edges of the images, drawing focus to the central part.
- **Dot Pixel Effect** :Transform the images into dot pixel art style with varying dot sizes.

## AI Filters (In Development)
The BrushMagic application is expanding its capabilities to include **AI-powered filters** that enhance and transform images using advanced algorithms. Currently, this section is under active development, and I am working on creating these AI models from scratch to provide unique and innovative filters.
